  "description": "Calculated - Total score based on a modified Beck's Depression Inventory 20-item questionnaire (all 20 items must have response). Each item is scored on a 4 point scale (from 0-3). The total score is the mean of all 20 items, multiplied by 21, with a possible range from 0 to 63. Higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms. A cut?off score indicative of mild depressive symptoms is greater than 10 and for severe depressive symptoms is greater than 30.
